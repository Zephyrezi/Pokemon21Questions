# Pokemon21Questions
Capstone Spring 2023

Our idea is reminiscent of the popular game â€œ20 questions". In our version, we are
hoping to create a program that correctly guesses a pokemon the user has in mind in 20
questions or less. The computer asks the user various questions such as the type or
skills of the pokemon and through the process of elimination, it will ask more specific
questions, until it runs out of questions or only 1 pokemon is left. We are hoping to find
open-source databases online with pokemon information since it is a popular game with
copious amounts of information. We would utilize these databases in our code to meet
our goal.

We are exploring options with languages, but are most likely to use Python and
JavaScript. We are also most likely going to use React for the front-end and also utilizing a Discord chatbox.
